## Introduction
Blockchain development is evolving rapidly, and understanding how to compile and deploy smart contracts is crucial. This repository aims to simplify the process using Web3.js, providing developers with a practical guide and code snippets.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:
- Node.js and npm
- Truffle HDWallet Provider
- Web3.js
- Solidity Compiler (solc)
- An Infura account for Ethereum endpoint

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.

## Compilation Script
- Customize the contract name in the `compile.js` script by replacing `"your-contract-name"` with your desired contract name.
- Run the script using `node compile.js` to compile your Solidity smart contract.

## Deployment Script
- Configure the HDWalletProvider with your mnemonic phrase and Infura endpoint in the `deploy.js` script.
- Run the script using `node deploy.js` to deploy your smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Conclusion
Thank you for exploring this guide and code repository. You are now equipped to dive into the world of Ethereum development. Feel free to customize, experiment, and embark on your blockchain journey with confidence. Happy coding! ðŸš€âœ¨
